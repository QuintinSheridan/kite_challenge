Please consider the following models. Assume these exist in an SQL database.

/*
Company
  - id
  - name (string)
  - description (text)
  - logo_url (string)
  - score (int)
  - has_many: funding_rounds

FundingRound
  - id (int)
  - funding_in_usd (float)
  - company_id
*/

You could make the id an autoincrementing integer key and make the Company table sorted by id.  This would speed up searching by id.

I honestly am not sure what you are asking here. This question is vague.
