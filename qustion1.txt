MVC stands for model view controller.  It is a software design pattern for how to handle the flow of information between the server, the client, and any required databases.  The model manages the data being used in the application and how the classes in the application relate to database tables.  Eg. a user instance may have a name, age and gender and user data could be stored ina table called users.  The view is how the information is displayed to the user such as charts, diagrams, and the rendering of available options to a user.  The controller takes user inputs such as form submissions and click events, eg. add new user to list and decides what information needs to be inserted/retrieved from a database to update the view.   

Two examples of MVCs are flask SQL alchemy for Python with a SQL backend and Mongoose for connecting MongoDB databases to Node.js applications.
