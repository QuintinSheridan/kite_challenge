I would like to join the Kite team to advance my skills for web application development while applying my knowledge of databases, data engineering, and data science.  I would like to work within a professional team to improve my abilities for front end development.
I appreciate the opportunity interview for the position.  I realize i did not perform well on the front end development in question 7 and i need to gain more experience in front end development.  That is why I am currently taking a course on React.js.
